        <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
        
At MUSTB, our journey began with a simple, shared passion: interior design. From an early age, we found joy in transforming spaces, whether it was rearranging furniture or experimenting with paint and decor to create spaces that felt like us. Over the years, this love for design grew into a dream to help others discover the joy of expressing themselves through interior design. Inspired by the endless possibilities that interior design offers, we decided to create a platform where design enthusiasts could find fresh ideas, expert tips, and a community of like-minded individuals. 
        </main>
        <p>Our goal is to make the world of interior design accessible to everyone, regardless of experience or budget, and to inspire others to personalize their spaces to reflect their unique style.</p>
